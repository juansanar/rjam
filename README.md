# What are R Jam Sessions?
[R Jam Sessions](https://juansamdphd.github.io/rjam/) are blocks of all things R and Data Science where I explore different datasets to practice and sharpen my `R` programming skills, statistical knowledge, and data visualization. I hope to inspire others to adapt `R` to their research and random explorations of the world, share their experience, and preach the power and impact of `R` and FOSS to their peers.

Hopefully this repo will keep growing as I (a recently turned wet-lab neurobiologist) keep learning R and Data Science to elevate my ressearch projects and curiosity *voyages*.
